# Travelers-Allocation
Allocation of travelers using destination routes (XML input files: travelers, planes, destination, and the result must be the XML file: assignment).


Create a Java project with the Swing interface to process information from XML files, resolve the theme, and then save the result to another XML file.
a) The interface must contain menus, simple controls (buttons, labels, textboxes, etc.), advanced controls (table, list, tree, etc.) and allow any entries in the input files to be edited.
b) The project classes will be grouped on packages according to their specificity.
c) Access to the application will be based on user and password.
